                <h2>Getting Blocked on a Simple Problem</h2>
                <p>
                    The fun thing about stepping outside is that the world isn't nicely put together how you like it. Nor is it optimised for keeping you safe. Coding can be like that too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The issue was that when you typed in a colour and hit 'submit' the colour would change but only for a split second. I thought for a long time that the issue was within the javascript (JS) code I had written. JS being the part of web development where you actually do 'programming' (whereas the other main parts, html & css are like making a colouring in book and then colouring it in respectively). I spent a lot of time Googling and watching videos on YouTube but my issue didn't seem to be anywhere.</p>
                <p>
                    After not getting any further with research I reached out to my peers to see if they had encountered a similar issue. While no one had one of my peers asked questions which made me explain the context further. This felt similar to a much more engaging than normal rubber ducky method. Which is where you normally talk to a 'rubber duck' in the same way you would explain an issue to a colleague providing the full context so they can help you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While talking with my peer and trying to troubleshoot further I made sure to track everything that was changing step by step. It became apparent that the actual page was refreshing when the submit button was being pressed. This meant that all of the input information was being reset. Finding this out by going through the program step by step gave me a specific area to Google. As it turns out there is a specific name you can give buttons to prevent this happening. Once I found this out the issue was resolved immediately.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One problem we came across was adding together a series of words. We were specifically supposed to use a specific command called <strong>concat</strong>. However, I was able to get the same functionality without using a pre-defined command in the javascript language. This might seem clunky as it is similar to only using 'basic' english when a more precise word could describe your state more specifically. e.g. Hungry is a basic word but peckish implies you're not too hungry but could snack for a little bit. My solution was like using the word hungry. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I like this however, as it shows that you can actually do anything you need to in programming using only a few fundamental concepts.
                </p>
                <h2>Reflection on Problem Solving</h2>
                <p>
                    One of the primary tools a software developer has available to them to problem solve is a debugger. And web developers have an additional tool called 'dev tools'. While these tools are powerful debuggers / dev tools won't necessarily say what's happening in the same language you or me would use to describe an issue. So it will be important to recognise what they're actually saying in their own language. One thing that going through problem solving this sprint has re-iterated is to pay very close attention to what happens at each step in the code. If I had known more about exactly dev tools was saying I would've been able to save a lot of time searching things which weren't the issue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During this particular sprint I didn't really need to go 'up the chain' in problem solving methods for the EDA content. I found that by understanding what the tests were wanting as an outcome I was usually able to provide a functional solution within ~10 to 20 minutes. If something wasn't working as intended using console.log() (which displays whatever you've put into the brackets is at the point in the code where console.log is written) helped me see where something wasn't working. Referring back to previous notes was also useful as I had written them in a way that I understood. Finally if neither of these worked then Google / Stack Overflow / MDN / W3Schools were all fantastic resources. As at this stage it's making sure I understand what the functions within Javascript actually do which is the sticking point. Rather than how to combine them in complex ways (which will come later).
                </p>
                <h2>Some Problem Solving Techniques</h2>
                <p>
                    I've found all of the following methods to be useful in my problem solving:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Pseudocode
                    </li>
                    <p>
                        This is useful when the code is slightly too complicated to hold in my head at once. I essentially ask myself 'what are we trying to do here' and outline what each step of the code is trying to do and how it will lead into the next. I've used it multiple times and is particularly helpful when figuring out when to pass certain data into specific methods.
                    </p>
                    <li>
                        Trying something
                    </li>
                    <p>
                        This is my bread and butter. I'll have an idea about what I'll want to do and then put it into code. Does it get the right output or am I getting an unexpected behaviour. It's also a great way to test out different methods or programming ideas in isolation to make sure I actually understand how it works before implementing it in the main body of the application.
                    </p>
                    <li>
                        Rubber Ducky Method
                    </li>
                    <p>
                        There's a great knowledge check which is trying to explain something to someone else. The problem is explaining something to someone else requires their time as well. By explaining it to an imaginary person or object you can get the benefit of breaking down your understanding of the code - while only using your own time. Often you can catch yourself what the issue is as you go through your problem.
                    </p>

                        Reading Error Messages
                    </li>
                    <p>
                        Compilers have come a long way. Often times the error message will be able to tell you exactly what's happening provided you can correctly interpret what it's saying. The earlier example of the page refreshing when pressing a button is a classic example of this. The console said 'navigated to xyz' where xyz is the html file location. This occurs when the page loads. If I had noticed this I would've known the page was refreshing immediately.
                    </p>
                    <li>
                        Console.logging
                    </li>
                    <p>
                        While debugging tools can give you a similar effect, setting breakpoints and stepping through the program can take a while. Using console.log enables you to quickly see what a value is at any given point in the program's execution. I've used this often to see for example why a counter isn't increasing when I expected it to. Or what the value of an element actually is versus what I expected it to be.
                    </p>
                    <li>

                    <p>
                        The search engine is what has enabled us as a species to move into the 'information age'. Provided you are proficient at using a search engine almost any answer to your question can be found. This is particularly true of programming where most questions a beginner can ask already have been. Typing in exact error messages, or how does 'x method work' will be able to return what you need.

                    <p>
                        This is particularly useful if none of the above has worked. Especially as your peers will likely be working on a similar problem and have an idea of the context you're working with. They also bring their own perspective and assumptions which will be different to my own which is useful if I'm stuck. As their mental framework of an issue might be more accurate than mine and be able to cut to the heart of the matter. I did this will trying figure out the button page refresh issue. And although my peers didn't know the answer they still asked good questions which helped me think in a different way.

                    <p>
                        Sometimes however, your peers are still equally stuck. And asking someone with more experience can help. At this stage I haven't had to use this tool as I've been comfortable enough with the concepts covered to resolve most issues on my own. However, in other contexts asking a manager or someone more senior in the organisation was been great. Especially as they'll likely understand the content as it fits into a wider context. And can easily see if you're going down a path which doesn't actually lead to the problem being resolved.

                        There's a model I really like called WDEP. What do you <strong>want</strong>? (W). What are you <strong>doing</strong>? (D). <strong>Evaluate</strong> is what you're doing working? (E). <strong>Plan</strong> an alternative approach if what you're doing isn't working (P). This is ultimately a process of continuous reflection and improvement and is something I hold very important as I go through life.
