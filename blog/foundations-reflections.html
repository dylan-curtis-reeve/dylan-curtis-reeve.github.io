                <h1>Foundations Reflections</h1>
                <h2>3 New Things I've learnt About Myself Through Core Learning</h2>
                <h3>I'm Fortunate In My Educational Upbringing</h3>
                <p>
                    When reviewing the core foundational skills which have been covered in the last 4 sprints none of the content was something I had encountered for the first time. Emotional intelligence, neuroplasticity, and focused listening and reflecting back of understanding are things I've tried to embed in myself for years. I've encountered these concepts through leadership training in the MBA, how to have growth focused conversations through the Glasser Institute, & Emotional intelligence again through the MBA, work, & psychology papers in my undergraduate degree.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That there will be people who are encountering these ideas for the first time through EDA makes me feel very grateful for the quality of my educational journey to this point. The fact that these ideas are being brought up in EDA is fanastic as I truely believe they are foundational skills for living with yourself and others effectively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ideas in thinking like a developer, identity & values, and creating a learning plan are also quite familiar to me. I have mulitple instances of journaling or going through reflective techniques to understand my values & identity. As a technical BA (Business Analayst) it was important to cultivate something akin to a developer mindset when writing requirements. Not to mention my own previous forays into code.
                </p>
                <h3>When I'm a Learning Customer I Want to Focus on the Areas of Growth I Came to Address</h3>
                <p>
                    Something both myself and my facilitator noticed with my blogs to this point is that they've been quite brief. Often to their detriment. This has been an interesting behaviour of mine as normally I tend to put forward a best effort in the work that I do. Reflecting on this more I believe this is because the content feels more like revision rather than pushing me into new areas of growth. The reason I came to EDA rather than creating my own learning plan for the first 3 months of my year off was to be immersed in code and be around others who were doing the same. With the intent of achieving rapid learning and growth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As such I've wanted to put my effort towards areas where there are gaps rather than reviewing content. Even when that content is something I hold dear and view as very important.
                </p>
                <h3>I Haven't Responded as Productively as I'd like to Putting On Breaks</h3>
                <p>
                    This was something I did find surprising. As I've found the technical content quite easy to this point (usually completing it all within a working day's amount of time) the rest of my week has been much less productive than I would've expected of myself. I've spent a lot more time on the couch with my partner than expected and haven't really been immersing myself in code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fortunately this isn't something I'm concerned about going forward post foundations as my expectation is there will be plenty to keep me busy daily. But feeling that I <em>shouldn't</em> progress past a certain point in the content lest I get ahead of the cohort too much has put a damper on my motivation to work hard. Even though this is actually false dilemma - in that I could've gone deeper into certain topics or code kata than I have. I think it is partly because I expected to be handed an intense cirriculum and then not need to think about my learning journey too much during my time at EDA to faciliatate maximum growth. Whereas (and I shouldn't be surprised by this), to get the most out of my time I will have to do some of my own learning topic / content planning. Which is all good - just a change to my expectations.
                </p>
                <h2>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
                <p>
                    In learning having empathy for yourself is very important. If you aren't grasping something understanding that it's a natural part of learning and not getting into a self-destructive mindset is vital. If this does start to happen then having the self-awareness of your own thoughts in what will help you realise you need to adjust your thinking to a more productive, kind state. Knowing your values and why you're learning the thing you're learning can help push through something hard knowing it serves a deeper purpose than simply knowing a fact or doing a thing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As programming is an act of perpetual learning having the above is very useful in persisting in a hard thing. It's also important from an external perspective as well. Treat others as you'd like to be treated is a saying most of us have heard from a young age. If you have a peer or colleague whose thinking or actions aren't helping them in their learning it's good to be able to understand where they're comming from. Or at least try to. Doing so can help you be a friend you would like to have in a situation where your personal actions might be self-defeating.
                </p>
                <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
                <p>
                    As mentioned in the first question nothing about the content itself has surprised me to this point. But knowing that I currently have a reaction of slowing myself down to move all the way to inactivity is helpful. As I can now think of strategies to address that behaviour earlier if I come across that type of situation again.
                </p>
                <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
                <p>
                    Making sure I'd actually answered all the questions in the blog post requirements right Naomi? ;)
                </p>
                <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h2>
                <p>
                    Because employers want to hire people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Programming doesn't happen in a vaccum. Software is operated by humans and is made by humans. This is even <strong>more</strong> true to web development than other areas (such as embedded systems where the output is manifested in a physical way). As programmers we will be working with other programmers, designers, analysts, and users to hopefully make the best system for the users (which also meets all the needs of the project sponsor). These programmers, designers, analysts and users will also be humans most of the time. To be ineffective at understanding others and communicating with them means that you'd be more likely to take the requirements exactly as written through your own biases.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you're unable to reflect or think inwardly about your actions and how they can influence others then chances are you will be a frustrating person to work with.
                </p>
                <h2>Has Core Felt Like a Waste of Time Where I Could've Been Programming?</h2>
                <p>
                    I think that all of the concepts covered in core to this point are extremely useful. If someone doesn't know about growth mindset, or have a basic tool for listening and understanding others then this journey will be even harder.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the hard things about running a school for adults is that everyone comes in with a wide variety of experience. Both in how long they've been alived and what they've done. For people who've just finished undergrad or highschool & haven't had to work in a group for anything significant this content will likely be novel and foundational. And it will likely enhance my personal experience going through EDA with people who've been exposed to these ideas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, as someone who has been through a variety of corporate roles, studied leadership at a postgraduate level, and had an innate interest in understanding my values, goals, and psychology this hasn't been new. And it hadn't even been very long since I had done some serious reflecting (having handed in my notice at work a couple months prior to starting EDA) so there wasn't much 'new' to be discovered. As such - so far - I haven't had much personal value added by doing the core taks. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    One potential other benefit to focusing on core though is we can point to the work like you can organisational values if someone hasn't fully embedded them and is causing harm to others in the team.
