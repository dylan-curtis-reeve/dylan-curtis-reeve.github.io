                <h1>Neuroplasticity & Growth Mindset</h1>
                <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
                <p>From my background in sport science the idea of neuroplasticity is shown through an individual getting stronger or learning a new skill. This occurs by the brain developing and refines motor patterns enabling them to be performed more efficiently. Intuitively this sounds like your hardwiring in a pattern - similarly to how you might burn an old PC monitor. Once it's embedded it's there. It only takes a look at physiotherapy to show that this isn't true. People can learn new movement patterns even though they have a lifetime of older ones.</p>
                <p>The formal definition of neuroplasticity is the ability of neural networks in the brain to change through growth and reorganization. In the past this was something that was thought to be strongest in children. And that as one gets older the brain becomes less capable of change. Anecdotally most people can think of example of an older individual that seems to have no interest or capacity to learn a new technology. However, this has been found to not actually be the case. Humans throughout the entire course of their lives are able to learn new patterns, skills, and abilities.</p>
                <p>
                    This is good news for people who want to learn a new language or instrument in retirement and are over the age of 18. The trouble with previous scientific thought is it can stay in the collective societal memory long after ideas have been disproven. And to quote Henry Ford (who I'm sure stole the phrase from someone else)

                    Growth Mindset
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Carol Dweck has devoted a large amount of her career to the concept of 'Growth Mindset' and its counter 'Fixed Mindset'. These ideas are about your belief that you have the capacity to improve. A person doesn't just have a growth mindset or a fixed mindset either. It is also context and topic specific. But once a person is aware of this framework there isn't anything preventing them from adopting it to all contexts. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    So what is growth mindset? It's the belief that your capacity to perform (or learn to perform) isn't 'fixed'. Or that with specific and consistent effort you can increase your skill in a particular domain. This is counter to a 'fixed' mindset where a person believes that they simply aren't good at something and to try and improve would not yeild any positive results. To have this mindset I personally feel is quite tragic as you can easily self-filter yourself out of a lot of opportunities that could be entirely obtainable.

                <p>
                    An area that Carol focused on in her research was in children. And the language others use around them can significantly influence children's views of themselves. The example often given is on celebrating a child doing well on a test. A response of 'oh you're so smart' while kind can actually re-enforce a fixed mindset. Which is the child may believe that they are just naturally talented in a subject. Having positive self-esteem can be good. However, this can create a challenging moment if they encounter situations where they find a task they had been led to believe they were gifted in difficult. Possibly even challenging their own self-worth.
                </p>
                <p>Language to encourage a growth mindset would sound closer to "great job, you worked really hard and it paid off!". This phrase encourages the idea that it was hard work that led to the positive outcome. So when a child comes across something difficult in the future they know it's hard work rather than a natural gift that will help them see success. Carol's research indicates that children with this type of belief are more resiliant as they grow older.</p>
