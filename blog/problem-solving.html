                    The fun thing about stepping outside is that the world isn't nicely put together how you like it. Nor is it optimised for keeping you safe. Coding can be like that too.

                    The issue was that when you typed in a colour and hit 'submit' the colour would change but only for a split second. I thought for a long time that the issue was within the javascript (JS) code I had written. JS being the part of web development where you actually do 'programming' (whereas the other main parts, html & css are like making a colouring in book and then colouring it in respectively). I spent a lot of time Googling and watching videos on YouTube but my issue didn't seem to be anywhere.</p>
                <p>
                    After not getting any further with research I reached out to my peers to see if they had encountered a similar issue. While no one had one of my peers asked questions which made me explain the context further. This felt similar to a much more engaging than normal rubber ducky method. Which is where you normally talk to a 'rubber duck' in the same way you would explain an issue to a colleague providing the full context so they can help you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While talking with my peer and trying to troubleshoot further I made sure to track everything that was changing step by step. It became apparent that the actual page was refreshing when the submit button was being pressed. This meant that all of the input information was being reset. Finding this out by going through the program step by step gave me a specific area to Google. As it turns out there is a specific name you can give buttons to prevent this happening. Once I found this out the issue was resolved immediately.

                    One problem we came across was adding together a series of words. We were specifically supposed to use a specific command called <strong>concat</strong>. However, I was able to get the same functionality without using a pre-defined command in the javascript language. This might seem clunky as it is similar to only using 'basic' english when a more precise word could describe your state more specifically. e.g. Hungry is a basic word but peckish implies you're not too hungry but could snack for a little bit. My solution was like using the word hungry. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I like this however, as it shows that you can actually do anything you need to in programming using only a few fundamental concepts.

                    One of the primary tools a software developer has available to them to problem solve is a debugger. And web developers have an additional tool called 'dev tools'. While these tools are powerful debuggers / dev tools won't necessarily say what's happening in the same language you or me would use to describe an issue. So it will be important to recognise what they're actually saying in their own language. One thing that going through problem solving this sprint has re-iterated is to pay very close attention to what happens at each step in the code. If I had known more about exactly dev tools was saying I would've been able to save a lot of time searching things which weren't the issue.

                    During this particular sprint I didn't really need to go 'up the chain' in problem solving methods for the EDA content. I found that by understanding what the tests were wanting as an outcome I was usually able to provide a functional solution within ~10 to 20 minutes. If something wasn't working as intended using console.log() (which displays whatever you've put into the brackets is at the point in the code where console.log is written) helped me see where something wasn't working. Referring back to previous notes was also useful as I had written them in a way that I understood. Finally if neither of these worked then Google / Stack Overflow / MDN / W3Schools were all fantastic resources. As at this stage it's making sure I understand what the functions within Javascript actually do which is the sticking point. Rather than how to combine them in complex ways (which will come later).
