                    <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
                    <p>
                        It can (and has) be theorised that it was due to emotional intelligence that humans are in the position we are today <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.anthro.32.061002.093158">[1]</a>.
                    The idea being that the cognitive strain of keeping in tune with how one acts around others while <em>also</em> keeping track of how others are behaving and speculating at their emotional state required our brains to evolve more processing power.
                We have become increasingly technically specialised over time, especially post industrial evolution <a href="https://hbr.org/2011/07/the-big-idea-the-age-of-hyperspecialization">[2]</a>. 
                With technology companies being by far the most valuable companies in the world (as quick look at largest companies ordered by market cap will show) it can be easy to assume that techical skills are the most valuable skill a person could hold in 2021.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If companies and the customers they served were entirely machines then perhaps this would be true. However, to be effective in an organisation or to simply be an effective organisation interacting with humans is still required (for now..).
                        And this doesn't even take into account that you can even spend time <em>outside</em> of work with other people as well! So what is emotional intelligence specifically?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Emotional intelligence can be broken down into 3 main components. <ul><li>Self-Awareness</li><li>Self-Management</li><li>Relationship-Management</li></ul>According to Daniel Goleman emotional intelligence is something that's still commonly misunderstood <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/12/what-people-still-get-wrong-about-emotional-intelligence">[3]</a>. It's not simply 'being nice'. 
                        And interestingly it can also be context specific. In the same article Goleman gives an example of a CFO who was highly emotionally intelligent around their friends and family but not around their co-workers. It's also possible to be emtionally intelligent and manipulative. 
                        In much the same way someone can be highly intelligent and still make poor decisions <a href="https://hbr.org/podcast/2021/05/why-smart-people-sometimes-make-bad-decisions">[4]</a>.  
                    </p>
                    <h2>Self Awareness</h2>
                    <p>Self awareness is about being conciously aware of your own emtions, strengths, weaknesses, needs, and drives <a href="https://hbr.org/2004/01/what-makes-a-leader?autocomplete=true">[5]</a>. I've personally found meditation to be a useful tool which helps me become an observer of myself. Rather than being the first thought that comes to mind. 
                    Much like a skill technical skill analysis people who are highly self-aware and effective know how to either work around their areas of weakness or have a plan for improving them.</p>
                    <h2>Self-Management</h2>
                    <p>
                        As mentioned above people who are effective work around their known weakness or address them. Coleman in a 2004 article on emotional intelligence mentions 'self-regulation' as an important component of emotional intelligence at work <a href="https://hbr.org/2004/01/what-makes-a-leader?autocomplete=true">[5]</a>. It's described as the ability to control or re-driect disrputive impulses and modds. The propsensity to suspend judgment - to think before acting. 
                        In short - to take your self awareness and act on it. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>Relationship Management</h2>
                    <p>
                        The third pillar in Coleman's EI framework is the ability to manage relationships. Those who are skilled in this area will have tha abillity to find common ground and build rapport with others <a href="https://hbr.org/2004/01/what-makes-a-leader?autocomplete=true">[5]</a>. 
                        This builds on the previous two pillars in that to be effective you need to know how your actions (explicit or implicit) have an effect on others.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I want to re-iterate that a person can understand these things and still make a choice to hurt others or manipulate people to their advantage. Being emotionally intelligent != being a good person. 
                        However, being emotionally intelligent does give you the skills required to work effectively with others. The best leaders (or poeple to work with in general) recognise that humnan interactions don't just happen once but over time. And as such building a positive relationship with others, 
                        taking into account their needs as well as your own is a fantastic recipie for something sustainable.
                    </p>
