        <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
        <h2>Key Elements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</li>
            <p>My goal for this year to spend a year of highly effective learning in the realm of web development and computer science. The intent is to build foundational knowledge such that I can build MVPs of technology products by myself. Whether I will immediately shift into staring my own company at the end of the year or work for another startup we shall see. But I'm intentionally leaving that open until nearer to the end of 2022 as I will have more information then.</p>
            <li>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</li>
            <p>On of my main strengths in learning are that I haven't really stopped. Having recently finished a masters while working full time and rising through the ranks at a financial services firm I also have a strong work ethic. I'm also in a position right now where I can study full-time for most of the year without any financial concerns. As a result of this I can focus a lot more time to my studies than in recent years. My main limitation is that in the past I've tried to build the skills I'm acquiring via EDA but failed due to prioritising other things.</p>
            <li>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</li>
            <p>Further refinement of technical communication in a way that non-technical decision makers can understand. I already have a base of this as a technical BA. But on reflection I likely leaned more heavily on jargon than I needed to.</p>
            <li>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</li><ul>
                <li>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives
                <li>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</li></ul>
            <p>I will schedule my day daily with 2-3 primary sub-goals to achieve and timebox in my calendar when I will work on these things. If the work isn't entirely individual I will also be sure to communicate what I expect to achieve in these time periods with my fellow learners & facilitators & request similar information from them. If it's unclear who has ownership of what particular tasks I will also look to make time with the team to make sure all tasks have an owner and that we're clear around who wants to do what (and what 'grunt' work needs to be evenly distributed). These sessions however, should be a safe space where people are free to raise concerns they have and ask for help.</p>
            <p>If I am in a situation where the workload becomes too great I will need to prioritise two things.<br>  1) My physical and mental health. Ensure that I am still exercising regularly and getting enough sleep while eating well.<br>  2) Reach out to my facilitator & team and let them know I'm concerned about meeting my deliverables and request we re-group and see if there's a fair way to either re-distribute work or adjust the requirements (time or content).</p>
            <li>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</li>
            <p>If I find I am stuck on a particular concept for more than 20 minutes and Google doesn't provide an answer I will first perform rubber ducky debugging. And try to explain my problem like I'm asking for help and giving as much context as possible. Should that fail I will then reachout to my peers on Slack. Following that if no one else in my cohort has any ideas then I will reach out to my facilitator. Recognising that they won't be in a position to respond immediately and that it will be best to work on something else in the interim.</p>
            <li>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</li>
            <p>Someone who is able to respond within 24 hours about problems if all other problemsolving is stuck. Also someone I can go to if I encounter a structural issue with EDA content or if my life situation changes and I need accomdations / breathing room to attend to life events.</p>
            <li>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.</li>
            <p>I already do this</p>
            <li>These elements do not need to be structured as they are in this list. You should put them together in the way that you feel they are most clearly communicated.</li>
