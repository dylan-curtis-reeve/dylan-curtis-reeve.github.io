        <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
        <h2>Key Elements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</li>
            <p>My goal for this year to spend a year of highly effective learning in the realm of web development and computer science. The intent is to build foundational knowledge such that I can build MVPs of technology products by myself. Whether I will immediately shift into staring my own company at the end of the year or work for another startup we shall see. But I'm intentionally leaving that open until nearer to the end of 2022 as I will have more information then.</p>
            <li>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</li>
            <p>On of my main strengths in learning are that I haven't really stopped. Having recently finished a masters while working full time and rising through the ranks at a financial services firm I also have a strong work ethic. I'm also in a position right now where I can study full-time for most of the year without any financial concerns. As a result of this I can focus a lot more time to my studies than in recent years. My main limitation is that in the past I've tried to build the skills I'm acquiring via EDA but failed due to prioritising other things.</p>
            <li>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</li>
            <p>Further refinement of technical communication in a way that non-technical decision makers can understand. I already have a base of this as a technical BA. But on reflection I likely leaned more heavily on jargon than I needed to.</p>
            <li>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</li><ul>
                <li>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives
                <li>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</li></ul>
            <p>I will schedule my day daily with 2-3 primary sub-goals to achieve and timebox in my calendar when I will work on these things. If the work isn't entirely individual I will also be sure to communicate what I expect to achieve in these time periods with my fellow learners & facilitators & request similar information from them. If it's unclear who has ownership of what particular tasks I will also look to make time with the team to make sure all tasks have an owner and that we're clear around who wants to do what (and what 'grunt' work needs to be evenly distributed). These sessions however, should be a safe space where people are free to raise concerns they have and ask for help.</p>
            <p>If I am in a situation where the workload becomes too great I will need to prioritise two things.<br>  1) My physical and mental health. Ensure that I am still exercising regularly and getting enough sleep while eating well.<br>  2) Reach out to my facilitator & team and let them know I'm concerned about meeting my deliverables and request we re-group and see if there's a fair way to either re-distribute work or adjust the requirements (time or content).</p>
            <li>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</li>
            <p>If I find I am stuck on a particular concept for more than 20 minutes and Google doesn't provide an answer I will first perform rubber ducky debugging. And try to explain my problem like I'm asking for help and giving as much context as possible. Should that fail I will then reachout to my peers on Slack. Following that if no one else in my cohort has any ideas then I will reach out to my facilitator. Recognising that they won't be in a position to respond immediately and that it will be best to work on something else in the interim.</p>
            <li>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</li>
            <p>Someone who is able to respond within 24 hours about problems if all other problemsolving is stuck. Also someone I can go to if I encounter a structural issue with EDA content or if my life situation changes and I need accomdations / breathing room to attend to life events.</p>
            <li>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.</li>
            <p>I already do this</p>

        <h1>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h1>
        <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
        <p>
            My goal has remained unchanged since the start of foundations.
        </p>
        <h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>
        <p>
          Based on my experience in foundations it seems likely I will find the technical componenets easier than some (although certainly not all) of the cohort. Having worked in teams which develop software before the cadence of sprints, standups, an retrospectives will feel normal to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          My concern is if I have an residual complancency from my experience in foundations. I want to make sure I'm pushing myself as much as I can while staying healthy. 
        </p>
        <h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
        <p>
          I think that navigating coversations in an environment where my peers will likely be stressed out and hired after pushing themselves all day could be a challenge. As it could potentially be an environment where people's fuses are shorter than normal.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, making sure my partner and family don't feel ignored while I'm either away from home or locked up in my office a large portion of each week for almost the rest of the year. I'm not very concerned about my communication ability in person with my peers at this stage.
        </p>
        <h2>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
        <p>
          My ability to briefly and accurately explain technical concepts without needing to use much jargon. Particularly be able to discuss tradeoffs with different approaches so that others can understand the difference between options to achieve a solution.
        </p>
        <h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
        <p>
          To provide a cirriculum which allows me to keep on pushing ahead. And are able to provide continual challenges but also guidance on where some good places are to look if Google and peers don't have ideas.
        </p>
        <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>
        <p>
          That I will make healthy choices when the opportunity for either that or something unhealthy present themselves. Both physically and socially. I will take a 'may I have some more' approach to learning at all times. And if the answer is no then I can alway do more Kata or other forms of practice. Having a backlog of things I want to explore will be helpful here.
        </p>
        <h2>Based on your knowledge of Bootcamp, how and where will you seek help in a timely way?</h2>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Google</li>
            <li>My Peers</li>
            <li>EDA Staff</li>
          </ul>
          In that order specifically.
        </p>
        <h2>Managing the Bootcamp Workload</h2>
        <p>
          <h3>Working with Others</h3>
          I will respect that everyone will find different parts of the bootcamp challenging. If I notice someone struggling with a concept I will be willing to help them understand it if it is something I've already grokked. If I don't then we can work together to find a solution.<br><br>
          I will also ensure I am getting enough sleep, exercise, and healthy food to give my brain the best chance of being attentive and effective during the day. Especially as we are learning in a cohort and my behaviour and mood can effect those around me (as theirs can effect me).<br><br>
          I will be appreciative of anyone in industry who is willing to take the time to be a part of our learning journey.

      <!-- 
        What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?

What are you hoping to use the skills you gain during this course for? What sort of impact would you like to make once you leave Dev Academy? Do you have a destination in mind?

What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?

Re-evaluate your strengths and limitations from Sprint 2. Has your idea of these changed over the course of Foundations? Have you discovered any new ones during this course? How do you think these will help/hinder you during Bootcamp?

What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?

While you will face many technical challenges on Bootcamp, this is not what we would like you to consider in this Plan. Non-technical challenges might include staying on top of the material, working in groups, speaking in front of the group, or keeping focused for 9 weeks, etc.

What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?

At Dev Academy we have a large focus around human skills and improving yourself. Based on your strengths/limitations, what are some areas for development you would like to work on?

For example, this could be things around communication, teamwork within groups, pairing with others, giving and receiving feedback, developing some leadership skills, or improving your self awareness and reflective skills.

What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?

What does support look like to you? Keep in mind, this may not be the same as the Bootcamp team's expectations, but it is useful to voice these expectations.

What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp

Based on your knowledge of Bootcamp, how and where will you seek help in a timely way?

Write down a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.
